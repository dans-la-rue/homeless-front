# Homeless-front

Display a list of all the shelters available to the homeless people.  
The number of available beds will be displayed next to each shelter.  
The numbers will be updated live by the owners of the shelters.  
A list of various available services (syringes, food location, ...) will be displayed to the homeless people along with the current state of the service.  
This PWA is installable on your devices. This allows you to access the different features while offline.  
No direct communication between the user and the admin of the shelters is allowed for "political reasons".
